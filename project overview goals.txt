BEACON_AI: Project Overview & Goals
===================================

1. CORE MISSION
---------------
To build a powerful, resilient, and privacy-focused Personal AI ecosystem ("BEACON") that empowers Micheal LaCourse to manage his family, finances, faith, and future efficiently. The system prioritizes local control, strictly curated biblical data, and practical home automation.

2. DUAL-AGENT STRATEGY

B. BIBLICAL AI ("The Strict Scholar")
   *   **Goal:** Truth, History, & Purity.
   *   **Personality:** Serious, precise, historical.
   *   **Permissions:** RESTRICTED. No modern theology. No "popular" internet Christianity.

3. HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE
------------------------
*   **Primary Node (Controller):** Windows Laptop (MSI GS66). Handles heavy AI processing, coding, and primary interface.
*   **Always-On Node (Server):** Raspberry Pi 4/5. Runs 24/7 background tasks (Cron jobs, Home Assistant, Daily Briefing generation).
*   **Storage:** 5TB External Drive attached to Pi for massive data storage (Media, Models, Backups).
*   **Mobile:** iPhone access via Web Dashboard (Flask/Streamlit).

4. EXPANSION MODULES (NEW)
--------------------------

5. IMMEDIATE GOALS

1.  **Stabilize Google Integration:** Ensure Budget and Calendar tools work flawlessly without quota errors.
2.  **Clean Knowledge Base:** Sanitize all text inputs (remove HTML/junk) for high-quality RAG.
3.  **Build Skeletons:** Implement the structure for the new Vision, Kitchen, and Media modules.
4.  **Deploy Mobile View:** Create a simple web view for checking the system status from a phone.
